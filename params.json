More directly, the end goal is to provide the necessary backend for\r\nall mods to cooperatively create a fantastic role-playing experience by giving\r\nboth developers and users the tools necessary to do so.\r\n\r\nCore Features\r\n-------------\r\n\r\n### Configurability\r\n\r\nSkillful has been designed to be *insanely configurable*, and you don’t need\r\nany modding experience to enjoy the benefits. Craft and design your skills and\r\nperks from scratch, and combine in-game events and effects in entirely new ways\r\nto create a completely unique experience.\r\n\r\nIntimidated by all of the options? Don’t worry! Sane defaults are included as\r\nwell. Through the use of **skill and perk packs**, third-party mods can add\r\npre-configured sets of skills and perks to provide a great experience with any\r\nsupported mod out of the box, with next to no configuration necessary.\r\n\r\n### Extensibility\r\n\r\nSkillful has been designed from the ground up to be *ridiculously extensible*.\r\nThird-party mods are treated as first-class citizens, and are able to add,\r\nremove, modify, or even replace entirely any piece of added functionality, all\r\nin a user-configurable way.\r\n\r\nOn top of this, the entire codebase has been obsessively documented, so if you\r\nwant to tweak something, help is readily available.\r\n\r\n### Concepts\r\n\r\n * Seed: some event that can cause a skill to gain in progress.\r\n * Skill: a metric of progress in some area. Skills are “seeded” by in-game\r\n   events to eventually increase in level.\r\n * Perk: a purchasable collection of one or more effects. Perks may have\r\n   associated requirements and costs.\r\n * Effect: some modification to the player.\r\n\r\nIn the coming days, expect these terms to be more fully defined on the wiki.\r\n\r\nExample Content\r\n---------------\r\n\r\n * Text UI screenshots: http://imgur.com/a/nYWSj#0\r\n * Sample skill configuration file: http://pastebin.com/TgQG0qrT\r\n * Sample perk configuration file: http://pastebin.com/YJQjG4SS\r\n\r\nLicensing and Modpack Use\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\nCode for the mod itself falls under the\r\n[MIT license](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) and can be freely used,\r\nmodified, and distributed for essentially any purpose.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, you may freely redistribute this mod without needing to request\r\npermission of any sort (including for use in mod packs). That said, we'd love to\r\nhear from you if you make creative use of it!\r\n\r\nThat said, if you do chose to make use of Skillful from within your own mod,\r\nplease *do not* include Skillful code directly in your own mod’s jar, and try\r\nto avoid redistributing the jar itself if possible, as doing so may cause\r\nversion and classloading conflicts. Please point your users to the relevant\r\nrelease on the [Releases page](https://github.com/timothyb89/skillful/releases)\r\nhere on Github whenever possible, thanks!\r\n\r\nDeveloper Notes\r\n===============\r\n\r\n * The project makes extensive use of\r\n   [Lombok annotations](http://projectlombok.org/). If you need to depend on\r\n   Skillful, you do **not** need to include Lombok.\r\n * [SnakeYAML](http://code.google.com/p/snakeyaml/) is required to parse\r\n   configuration files. You may download it from\r\n   [Maven Central](http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.yaml/snakeyaml/1.14).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
